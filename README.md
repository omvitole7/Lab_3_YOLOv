# YOLO Assignment

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for Lab Assignment 3 related to YOLO (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm.

## Contents
- Assignment Report: Detailed explanation of the experiment, findings, and results.
- **Jupyter Notebook (Lab Assignment 3.ipynb): Contains the code implementation for object detection using YOLO.
- Datasets (if applicable): Preprocessed images and sample datasets used for testing YOLO.
- Results and Visualizations: Output images showcasing detection results.

## Installation
To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
bash
pip install numpy opencv-python torch torchvision matplotlib


## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolo-assignment.git
   cd yolo-assignment
   
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   bash
   jupyter notebook Lab\ Assignment\ 3.ipynb
   
3. Run the notebook cells to execute object detection using YOLO.

## Expected Output
- The notebook will load an image/video and detect objects using YOLO.
- Detected objects will be annotated with bounding boxes and class labels.
